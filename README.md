# Airbnb Boston Data Analysis - Kaggle

Background

In this project, Airbnb Boston data was analyzed to understand key trends in the short-term rental market. The objective was to identify factors influencing rental prices, assess customer satisfaction levels, and explore demand patterns by location and time periods.

Workflow Steps

# 1. Data Collection and Understanding

The data was sourced from Kaggle and included information on Airbnb-listed properties in Boston, such as:

Prices

Guest ratings

Property descriptions

Availability and bookings

Location

Number of rooms and additional amenities

# 2. Data Cleaning and Processing

Several data preprocessing steps were performed, including:

Handling missing values (Imputation)

Removing outliers (Outliers Detection)

Converting categorical variables to numerical values

Feature engineering to create new relevant attributes

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization was performed using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to investigate key questions such as:

How does price vary by location?

Is there seasonal fluctuation in prices?

Which features have the most impact on price?

How does the host rating influence rental success?

# 4. Building a Price Prediction Model

Property price predictions were made using Machine Learning models, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

The goal was to develop a model that accurately predicts rental prices based on property features. Model performance was compared using MAE and RMSE metrics.

# 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

Certain areas, especially downtown, had significantly higher prices.

Properties with higher host ratings tend to charge more.

Features such as the number of rooms, amenities, and detailed property descriptions significantly impact pricing.

Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance for price predictions.

Technologies and Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook

Kaggle Notebooks

Replit

Execution Steps

Upload the three project Excel files to Replit.

Upload the Jupyter Notebook file named Boston_Prices_Project.

Run the code to analyze the data and predict rental prices.



# Summary

This project provided valuable insights into Airbnb rental prices in Boston and enabled accurate price predictions. Combining data analysis and Machine Learning helped to better understand market dynamics and identify key trends.
